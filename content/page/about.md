My name is Nolan Price, and I am a programmer. I wrote my first program when I was 18 in my
first year of college and felt sad that I hadn't been doing it my whole life. I missed
out on a lot of the "tinkering" that most of my co-workers did their whole lives, so
I'm making up for lost time. I try and learn about everything I missed out on like
exploring programming languages (even the awful ones like C. Yes I said it), messing
around with electronics, 3d modeling/printing, and anything else that strikes my fancy.
